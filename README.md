This repository demonstrates a common VHDL error related to signal assignment timing within processes.  The `bug.vhdl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.vhdl` provides the corrected version. The problem arises because signal assignments are scheduled, not immediately executed.  Therefore, changes to the signal might not be visible until the next clock cycle, especially if complex conditions or other signals changing in the same clock cycle are involved. This can lead to unexpected and difficult-to-debug timing errors.  The solution involves understanding and correctly handling signal assignment scheduling in VHDL to ensure the intended behavior.
